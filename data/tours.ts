Trekking the mountain will undoubtedly reward you with spectacular scenery as well as sightings of elusive wildlife such as Geleda Baboons, and Simien fox (key kebero).

        And even if the excursion lasts for four days, you will definitely have a wonderful time. The fresh air you breathe, the magnificent landscape, and the memorable camping experiences you have will make your trekking experience one-of-a-kind.`,
